# Decentraland Personal Parcel Project


## About 

Designing my personal Decentraland parcel (which I acquired long ago) to be an obstacle course for people to attempt. 
Those who dare to attempt the course will have to pay a standard MANA fee (don't worry it's super cheap!). 

Individuals who successfully complete the course will be added to a list of all Individuals that have successfully finished the course. In addition, the top 10 fastest times will be listed on the leaderboards for everyone to see.

Obstacle course will change periodically (after a lot of completions) and the fastest time for that course will be rewarded with some MANA and will be crowned champion having the best time for the course.

Currently working on the first course.
Disclaimer: (Project idea is subject to change)


## How it's being created (tools, services, and languages)

This project is being created using the Decentraland (DCL) SDK, which also consists of the DCL CLI and DCL API.

3D models for the course are either created by me or used from online. (will provide credit below for each model used from online)

Majority of the coding will be using Typescript as that is the main supported language of the DCL SDK.
